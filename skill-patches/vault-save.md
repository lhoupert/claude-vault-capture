description: Export a Claude-generated markdown document to the Obsidian vault (claude-docs/) with structured frontmatter, filename sanitization, and collision checks. Use when asked to save, export, or store a document to the vault or notes ("save this to my vault", "export this spec", "add this to Obsidian").

# /vault-save — Export a document to the Obsidian vault

Save a Claude-generated markdown document to `__VAULT_DIR__/claude-docs/` with structured frontmatter. Works mid-session without waiting for SessionEnd capture.

---

## Step 1 — Identify the document to save

Look through the current conversation for markdown documents Claude generated (specs, plans, ADRs, runbooks, issues, notes). A "document" is a self-contained piece of writing, not a code snippet or a conversational reply.

- If there is exactly one clear candidate, use it.
- If the user specified which document (e.g. "save the spec above"), use that one.
- If there are multiple candidates, list them briefly and ask: "Which document should I save?" — wait for the user to choose before continuing.
- If the document was provided inline in the `/vault-save` invocation, use that content.

## Step 2 — Infer document metadata

Derive the following fields from the document content and the current working directory.

**type** — choose the best fit:
- `spec` — requirements or feature specification
- `plan` — implementation plan or task breakdown
- `adr` — architecture decision record
- `runbook` — operational procedure or how-to
- `issue` — bug report or GitHub issue draft
- `note` — reference note, research finding, or concept explanation
- `document` — anything that does not fit the above

**title** — use the first H1 heading (`# …`) in the document, or the first H2 if no H1 exists, or ask the user if neither exists. Sanitize: remove `|`, `]]`, `[[`, `#`, and backtick characters; collapse multiple spaces to one; truncate to 120 characters.

**project** — run `git -C <cwd> rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename` to get the repo name, falling back to `home` if not in a git repo or the command fails.

**tags** — generate 2–5 topic tags inferred from the document content. Always include `claude-code` and the project name. Use lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g. `api-design`, `auth-flow`).

**created** — today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

**model** — the current model ID (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`).

**Step 2c — Infer `summary`**: Write one sentence (≤ 140 characters) describing what this document is. Prose, no markdown. Sanitize same as title: remove `|`, `]]`, `[[`, `#`, backticks, control characters; collapse whitespace. Self-check the character count before proceeding — if it exceeds 140 chars, shorten it until it fits.

Example — too long (145 chars):
> "Specification for the vault-save refactor that moves exports from Inbox/auto to claude-docs and adds summary and description frontmatter fields."

Shortened to ≤ 140:
> "Specification for vault-save refactor: moves exports to claude-docs/ and adds summary and description frontmatter."

**Step 2d — Infer `description`**: Write 1–3 short paragraphs expanding on the summary. Rules for writing the YAML literal block scalar:
- Start the value with `description: |`
- Every content line must be indented by exactly 2 spaces
- Blank lines between paragraphs must be completely empty (no spaces)
- Never include a line that is exactly `---` — it would be misread as a YAML document separator
- The block ends when indentation returns to zero (i.e., the next YAML key or the closing `---`)

Example:
```
description: |
  This plan documents the /vault-save refactor, moving exports from Inbox/auto/
  to a top-level claude-docs/ folder for clarity.

  The refactor also adds summary (≤140 chars) and description (literal block)
  to frontmatter, making saved documents self-describing in Obsidian.
```

## Step 3 — Generate the filename

1. Take the sanitized title from Step 2.
2. NFKD-normalize, lowercase, replace every character outside `[a-z0-9]` with `-`, collapse consecutive hyphens, strip leading/trailing hyphens. Truncate to 60 characters.
3. Assemble: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
4. Check whether `__VAULT_DIR__/claude-docs/<filename>` already exists. If it does, append `-2`, `-3`, etc. until the path is free.

## Step 4 — Write the file

Write the complete file to `__VAULT_DIR__/claude-docs/<filename>` with this exact structure:

```
---
title: <sanitized title>
summary: <one sentence, ≤140 chars, sanitized>
description: |
  <paragraph 1, indented 2 spaces>

  <paragraph 2, indented 2 spaces>
type: <type>
project: <project>
tags: [<tag1>, <tag2>, ...]
source: claude-code-export
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
model: <model-id>
---

<document body — verbatim content, preserving all headings, code blocks, and lists>
```

Do not add a `## Referenced in` section — it is appended later (if at all) by an Inbox-triage extension when the document is linked from a daily/weekly note.

## Step 5 — Confirm

Report the saved location to the user:

```
Saved to claude-docs/<filename>
```

If the write fails for any reason, report the error and do not retry silently.
