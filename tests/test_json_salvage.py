"""Salvage valid JSON from decorated model output (subscription agentic leaks).

The subscription runtime sometimes echoes transcript delimiters or prefixes
prose around otherwise-valid JSON (observed in hooks.log 2026-06-16 → 2026-07-15:
`----- END TRANSCRIPT -----` echoes and `Human: ```json {…` fence lines that
